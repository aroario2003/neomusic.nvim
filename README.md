## About

Some people like to listen to music while they code, however, in order to do so they must use another application in order to play their songs, which interrupts the workflow and flowstate that maybe present. This plugin gets rid of that need and lets you stay in neovim while you play your favorite playlist. Less distractions = More productivity.
